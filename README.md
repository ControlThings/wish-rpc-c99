# Wish RPC implentation

Warning: This code cannot be built on its own. It only works when included from projects that used this code before it was extracted.

This is a generic BSON based RPC implementation. 

## Dependencies

This repository was extracted from the monolithic wish/mist repository. It requires bson, cBSON and utlib. It also expects wish_platform_malloc and other platform abstraction functions to be implemented.
